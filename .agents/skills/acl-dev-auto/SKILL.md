## 🚦 Universal Phase Gate Precondition (Mandatory & Non-Negotiable)
Before executing any actions, adopting any persona, greeting the user, or producing output:
1. Scan all existing markdown files in `_acl-output/` (or run `node tools/adlc-gate-guard.js`).
2. If ANY prerequisite markdown file in `_acl-output/` is missing, or has ANY status other than `Accepted` (e.g. `In Review`, `draft`, `Pending`, `Rejected`):
   - **TOTAL AGENT BLOCK (NO PERSONAS, NO CHATTING, NO BRAINSTORMING, NO FILE GENERATION)**:
     - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from adopting personas or greeting the user as an agent.
     - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from offering conversational advice, whiteboard diagrams, or brainstorming in chat while waiting for approval.
     - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from creating, updating, or modifying downstream files.
     - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from asking or suggesting the user/developer to self-approve or change the status.
   - **THE ONLY PERMITTED ACTION**: Output the official waiting message:
     ```text
     ========================================================================
     ⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)
     ========================================================================
     📄 Document in Review: One or more prerequisite documents in _acl-output/ are currently IN REVIEW / PENDING.
     🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW / PENDING]

     ⚠️ STATUS:
        As per the ACL-ADLC sequential delivery framework, this document 
        is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.

     👉 NEXT STEP:
        Please wait for your manager to review and mark this document as 
        'Accepted' or 'Rejected' in Markdown Studio before proceeding with 
        downstream tasks.
     ========================================================================
     ```
3. Only proceed if ALL existing documents in `_acl-output/` have `status: Accepted`.



Run this single command exactly once, substituting the absolute project and skill roots without changing the working directory:

```bash
uv run --no-cache "{project-root}/_acl/scripts/render_skill.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}"
```

- On success, read and follow the one absolute `workflow.md` instruction printed to stdout.
- On failure (including `uv` being unavailable), report the command output and HALT. Do not run any workflow source directly.
